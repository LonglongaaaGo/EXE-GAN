# Do Inpainting Yourself: Generative Facial Inpainting Guided by Exemplars (EXE-GAN)
Official PyTorch implementation of EXE-GAN (Coming soon).
[[Homepage]](https://longlongaaago.github.io/EXE-GAN/)

<div style="text-align: justify"> We present EXE-GAN, a novel exemplar-guided facial inpainting framework using generative adversarial networks. Our
approach can not only preserve the quality of the input facial image but also complete the image with exemplar-like facial attributes.</div>
